<h2>Genetic Algorithm</h2>

This repository contains a project based on genetic algorithm. The goal here is to find the best gym for a beginner, using some google APIs, such as Google Maps Javascript API and Google Places API web service.

One must remember that in this code we used a particular API key to make data requests. Thus, in order to run this code in your computer, you probably will need your own API key.

In a few days this place will be full updated and the project explained from its modelling to its implementation.
