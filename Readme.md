Welcome, here you will find heuristics search methods algorithms developed in the course of Applied Artificial Intelligence from the B.Sc. Computer Engineering at Federal University of Rio Grande Do Norte.

The AG repository contains an implementation of an algorithm based in the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Such implementation aims to help people in the decision-making process about which gym is best for them to begin aerobic and weight training workout in the city of Natal, RN-Brazil. 

The PSO repository contains an implementation of an algorithm based in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)heuristic. The goal of the algorithm is to find the global minima of any 2-dimensional function. In this case, more specifically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function">Rosenbrock's Function</a> was used as an example.

As a reference about the model and performance of the GA and PSO heuristics, I recommend the reading of <i>A comparison of particle swarm optimization and the genetic algorithm</i> written by Rania Hassan, Babak Cohanim, Olivier de Weck and Gerhard Venter.

I sincerely thank to Gabriel Coelho and Josué Araújo for their precious insights on the codes developed here. Friendship is about building a better world and it also means helping others coding.
